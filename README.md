# HomeGreenery

The goal of this project was to create a webpage with HTML and CSS by replicating a design, as closely as possible, from a designer's mock-up layout (see the included Mock_up_layout.png file). Only a PNG file was provided for this project and it was up to the developer to determine the correct colours, font-sizes, and dimensions to use for each element. As an added challenge, no advanced CSS features were used to create this webpage (no flexbox or grid, no external libraries).
